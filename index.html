    <h2>This website</h2>

    <p>Everything on this website is a work-in-progress. It's unlikely it will stay the same forever, I will always be tinkering, but I will try and keep pages evergreen, or at least up-to-date where I can.

    <p>Listed below are various pages you can find here on this website:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/reviews">Reviews</a> of things I have been engaging with lately</li>
      <li><a href="/timeline">Timeline of Earth History</a> a fruitless attempt at writing a chronology of all of this</li>
      <li><a href="/questions">Questions</a> (and some answers)</li>
      <li><a href="/adages">Adages</a> some rules of thumb which might help simplify decision making</li>
    </ul>
